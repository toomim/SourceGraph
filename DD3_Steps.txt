Design Doc 3: Steps

A common mistake I make is not starting simply enough. Let's attempt to start as simple as possible.

1. Writing Panel
    - writing space (done)
    - metadata
2. Text Saving
    - Just use JS FS api... get the file system going tonight...
    - make a simple API and then deadend at local filesystem
    - Rust server API
    - JS filesystem API https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/
3. Reading Panel (display saved text)
4. N-Panels
5. Adjustable Panels
6. Side Tabs
7. Reading highlights
    - Highlight and
8. Diff


Note: At a process level, ideate then pear down
